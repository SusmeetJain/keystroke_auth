# Keystroke Authentication

Data-X : Keystroke dynamics based password authentication

Problem Statement:

Two factor authentication is recommended by most major consumer facing applications. However, the extra step, often entering a One-Time-Password, is cumbersome as it adds delay and involves the use of an extra application, usually text message/email, in order to log-in to the original application. This also imposes a lot of cost on the companies. We propose a solution that can replace the existing means of second factor authentication, bring down the costs involved, eliminate external dependencies like network access and with no extra hardware needed.
